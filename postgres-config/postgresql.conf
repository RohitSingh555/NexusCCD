# PostgreSQL Configuration for NexusCCD
# This file increases max_stack_depth to handle complex bulk update queries

# Increase stack depth limit from default 2MB to 4MB
# This allows for more complex SQL queries with large IN clauses
# Safe limit: 4MB is well within PostgreSQL's recommended range (up to 7MB)
max_stack_depth = 4096kB

# Optional: Increase work_mem for better query performance with large datasets
# This helps with sorting and hashing operations during bulk updates
work_mem = 16MB

# Optional: Increase maintenance_work_mem for bulk operations
maintenance_work_mem = 128MB
